XGS-PIC-Raycasting-Engine
=========================

This is a raycasting engine for the XGS-PIC 16 bit. The code is very very alpha.

Fixed point math is used. There's a lot of commented out code where I was working on converting to fixed from floating point.

Known bugs:

Somethings not right with the fixed point math. There's a fisheye affect.

Sometimes the entire thing glitches out and gets trippy.
